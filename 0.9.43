{"body": "before this the file appends were treated as singular events without considering if there were other appends in progress. This was causing weird things. Now I have built a queueing mechanism where appends are done in a more sequential manner. And workspaces rerun only when this queue is empty. In a way I am prioritising data appends over reruns. And this also means that the workers are not used up to rerun workspaces when the rerun is pretty useless. Since the new data would warrant a rerun anyway", "tag_name": "0.9.43", "title": "Improved file append logic"}
